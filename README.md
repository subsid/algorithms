* Low/high index
* Max in sliding window
* Maximum single sell profit
* Merge overlapping sorted intervals
* Zeros to the left
* Quicksort
* Rotate Array
* Search sorted rotated array
* Find smallest common number in sorted arrays.
* 2-sum
* Most frequent k

## LinkedList

* Add two integers
* Deep copy with arbitrary pointers
* Delete node
* Insertion sort
* Intersection point
* Merge sort
* Merge sorted lists

* Integer Division (without using * and /)
* Given a set of n elements find their kth permutation. (with ordering)
* Prime factors of given number
* Pythagorean Triplets
* All permutations of given string. (handle duplicates)
* All subset
* Power of a number
* Calculate square root

## Strings
